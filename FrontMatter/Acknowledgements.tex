\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\doublespacing
You must pay your scholarly debts by thanking those who have provided intellectual guidance, facilities, or financial support for your project; thus, you thank those who have been significantly involved in your work. You must acknowledge any agency providing funding or other resources, and any individual or institution who has granted you permission to reprint material.

If you wish, you may also thank family or friends. You may conclude your acknowledgments with a dedication rather than using a separate dedication page. Your acknowledgments should be brief and consistent in tone with a formal publication.
